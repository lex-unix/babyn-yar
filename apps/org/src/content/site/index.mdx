## Menorah

The bronze memorial with words from the Bible inscribed in two languages, "The
voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground", is heavy,
painful, and full of sadness but accurate and honest. A living memory of the
Jews who were executed during the occupation of Kyiv. The unveiling of the
bronze seven-branched candelabrum, a symbol of Jewish culture, occurred on the
50th anniversary of the Babyn Yar tragedy in 1991.

## The symbolic Synagogue "Place for Reflection"

On May 14, 2021, a symbolic Synagogue appeared on the slopes of Babyn Yar. For
the first time, the country commemorated the Day of Remembrance for Ukrainians
who rescued Jews during World War II. The location was not chosen by chance; the
slope next to the Menorah had long been considered a place of sorrow and prayer.
It is decorated in the style of ancient synagogues destroyed during the war;
"Place for Reflection" opens like a book for all who wish to honor the memory of
the tragedy's victims.
