## Matvii Vaisberh's murals in Babyn Yar are a symbol of resistance and unity

In May 2023, Ukrainian artist Matvii Vaisberh created three monumental murals in Babyn Yar: “Angel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine”, “Star of David”, and “Menorah”. These works are from his "Travel Diary" created from March to May 2022. Matvii Vaisberh stated, "Painting at that time was not only an attempt not to go crazy, but also a hope to help in some way, to make my own, the only possible small contribution to helping my country in these circumstances”.

The "Menorah" mural, a ritual Jewish seven-branched candlestick with one broken candle, tells the tragic story that repeated itself in Babyn Yar on March 1, 2022, when people lost their lives due to russian missile attacks.

The "Angel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine" depicts a heavenly guardian with a sword, protecting the sea of humanity beneath. "The “Star of David” represents our common Jewish history in Ukraine.

These works are not only a symbol of resistance, but also of unity in the fight against evil. They are a must-see.
