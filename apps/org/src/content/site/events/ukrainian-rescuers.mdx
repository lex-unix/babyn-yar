## Day of Remembrance for Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II 

Every year on May 14 the Day of Remembrance is observed in honor of Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II. There are many stories of Ukrainians saving Jews, not all of them documented, but the memory of thousands of Jews saved from death lives on in our nations.

This year honoring of Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II took place during a joint interfaith prayer at Babyn Yar, organized by the Babyn Yar National Historical Memorial Preserve with the support of the All-Ukrainian Charitable Fund “To You” (2U).

"Thousands of lives saved by Ukrainians have turned into tens of thousands of descendants of the Jewish people, who have become scientists, artists, doctors, and teachers, glorifying their country and making the world a better place through their work," noted Roza Tapanova, the head of the Babyn Yar National Historical Memorial Preserve.

The bravery of Ukrainians has been recognized by the State of Israel. Ukraine ranks fourth in the number of Righteous Among the Nations. This title is bestowed by the Israeli National Holocaust and Heroism Memorial “Yad Vashem”.

The value of human life is the highest priority for our country. Just as eighty-four years ago and now, during the russian aggression, we stand against evil, the killing of innocent civilians, and all forms of genocide.
