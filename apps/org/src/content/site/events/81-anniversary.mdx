the tragedy took place at the Babyn Yar National Historical and Memorial
Reserve.

An audiovisual installation, "The Black Cube of Time,‚Äù was presented, reflecting
the idea of a "living wound that will never heal." Through audiovisual effects,
the installation helps visitors emotionally feel the echoes of the tragedy,
which still haunts us even after 80 years.

Also, during these days, other installations were opened for visitors, including

Reflection," and the Matviy Weisberg art exhibition "Alien Homes" - a series of
paintings depicting the homes of Jews that were destroyed during the Holocaust.

The anniversary in the times of pain, this living pain that the people of
Ukraine are experiencing today, reminds us that war is evil and genocide should
never exist on Earth.
