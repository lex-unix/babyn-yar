        In 2024, the National Historical and Memorial Reserve Babyn Yar
        established its own distinction — the <strong
          >“Living Memory” Award</strong
        >, created to honor individuals whose work has made a significant
        contribution to preserving the memory of the Babyn Yar tragedy and
        ensuring it is never forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        The commemorative sign, designed especially for the Reserve by
        Kyiv-based artist and jeweler <strong>Denys Muzyka</strong>, is crafted
        from titanium in the form of a tree cross-section with annual rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its symbolism reflects the continuity of history, the accumulation of
        experience, and the persistence of memory. Each ring represents a year
        that has left its trace in our shared history, embodying resilience and
        the responsibility to preserve the memory of crimes against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The “Living Memory” Award seeks to recognize those who, through their
        dedication, research, artistic expression, and civic engagement, help
        safeguard the remembrance of Babyn Yar and counter the threat of
        oblivion.
