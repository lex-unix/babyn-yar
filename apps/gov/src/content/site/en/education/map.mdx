## Map of Holocaust in Ukraine

During the Holocaust in Ukraine, the Nazis killed 1.5 million Jews, but after
the war, we faced 80 years of suppression of memory of these tragic events. The
Soviet authorities kept silent about the facts, thereby destroying the memory of
the nation, which became a true Holocaust of identity.

The important step towards honoring and preserving cultural heritage is the
meticulous collection of all Jewish memorial sites. This map will help to
understand the scale of the tragedy, indicating memorials and places of mass
executions of Jewish during World War II.

The map will be updated according to new findings of memorial sites. The first
version of the Holocaust Map in Ukraine was created based on information from
