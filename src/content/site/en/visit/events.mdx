An audiovisual installation, "The Black Cube of Time,‚Äù was presented, reflecting the idea of a "living wound that will never heal." Through audiovisual effects, the installation helps visitors emotionally feel the echoes of the tragedy, which still haunts us even after 80 years.

The anniversary in the times of pain, this living pain that the people of Ukraine are experiencing today, reminds us that war is evil and genocide should never exist on Earth.
